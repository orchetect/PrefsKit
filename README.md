A modern Swift library for reading & writing app preferences:

- simple but powerful DSL
- swappable/mockable storage backend (UserDefaults, Dictionary, PList file, and more)
- keys are `Observable` for effortless integration in modern SwiftUI apps
- built from the ground up for Swift 6

## Quick Start

1. Add PrefsKit to your app or package
2. Create a schema that defines the backing storage and preference key/value types.
   - Apply the `@PrefsSchema` attribute to the class.
   - Define your `storage` and `storageMode`. (These may also be passed in later via an init if desired.)
   - Use the `@Pref` attribute to declare individual preference keys and their value type.
     Value types may be `Optional` or have a default value.
   ```swift
   import Foundation
   import PrefsKit
   
   @PrefsSchema final class Prefs {
       let storage = UserDefaultsPrefsStorage()
       let storageMode: PrefsSchemaMode = .cachedReadStorageWrite
       
       @Pref var foo: String?
       @Pref var bar: Int = 123
       @Pref var bool: Bool = false
       @Pref var array: [String]?
       @Pref var dict: [String: Int]?
   }
   ```
   > Atomic value types available: 
   >
   > - `String`, `Bool`, `Int`, `Double`, `Float`, `Data`
   > - `Array` containing values of the above atomic types
   > - `Dictionary` keyed by `String` containing values of the above atomic types
3. Instantiate the class in the appropriate scope. If you are defining application preferences, the App struct is a good place to store it. It may be passed into the environment so that any subview can access it.
   ```swift
   struct MyApp: App {
       @State private var prefs = Prefs()
       
       var body: some Scene {
           ContentView()
               .environment(prefs)
       }
   }
   ```
4. The class is implicitly `@Observable` so its properties can trigger SwiftUI view updates and be used as bindings.
   ```swift
   struct ContentView: View {
       @Environment(Prefs.self) private var prefs
       
       var body: some View {
           Text("String: \(prefs.foo ?? "Not yet set.")")
           Text("Int: \(prefs.bar)")
           Toggle("Toggle State", isOn: $prefs.bool)
       }
   }
   ```

## Advanced Concepts

### Key Names

Key names are synthesized from the var name unless specified:

```swift
@Pref var foo: String? // storage key name is "foo"
@Pref(key: "bar") var foo: String? // storage key name is "Bar"
```

### Complex Value Types

Alternative macros are available for more complex types such as:

#### `@RawRepresentablePref`

Allows using a `RawRepresentable` type with a `RawValue` that is one of the supported atomic storage value types.

```swift
@PrefsSchema final class Prefs {
    @RawRepresentablePref var fruit: Fruit?
}
  
enum Fruit: String {
    case apple, banana, orange
}
```
#### `@JSONCodablePref`

Convenience to encode and decode any `Codable` type as JSON `Data`.

```swift
@PrefsSchema final class Prefs {
    @JSONCodablePref var device: Device?
    @JSONCodablePref var deviceID: UUID? // UUID natively conforms to Codable
}
  
struct Device: Codable {
    var name: String
    var manufacturer: String
}
```
#### `@Pref(encode:decode:)` and `@Pref(coding:)`

Supports custom *value ‚Üê‚Üí storage value* encoding implementation.

```swift
@PrefsSchema final class Prefs {
    // can be defined inline
    @Pref(encode: { $0.absoluteString }, decode: { URL(string: $0) })
    var url: URL?
    
    // or coding can be defined once and used multiple times
    let urlCoding = PrefsCoding(encode: { $0.absoluteString },
                                decode: { URL(string: $0) })
    @Pref(coding: urlCoding) var foo: URL?
    @Pref(coding: urlCoding) var bar: URL?
}
```

## FAQ

- Why not use `@AppStorage`?

  The 1st-party provided `@AppStorage` property wrapper is convenient and perfectly fine for small apps that do not require robust storage flexibility or prefs isolation / mocking for integration testing or unit testing.

  It also is fairly limited in the value types it supports. PrefsKit offers an easy to use, extensible blueprint for defining and using encoding strategies for any value type.

- Why not use SwiftData?

  SwiftData is more oriented towards data models and user document content. It requires some adaptation and boilerplate to shoehorn it into the role of application preferences storage. It also has a somewhat steep learning curve and may contain more features than are necessary.

  PrefsKit is purpose-built for preference storage.

- Why not use UserDefaults directly?

  For small apps this approach may be adequate. However it forms tight coupling to UserDefaults as a storage backend. This means automated integration testing can't as easily be performed with isolated/mocked preferences. Even if the approach of using separate UserDefaults suites for testing is employed, the coupling makes changing storage backend in the future more time-intensive.

  PrefsKit adds the ability to swap out the storage backend at any time in the future, in addition to its easy to use, extensible blueprints for defining and using encoding strategies for value types.
